# Word-Frequency-Counter
This project aims to find the ten most frequently used words from the given URL.

It prompts the user to enter a URL, processes it, and store the frequent words in the database.
Whenever a new URL is entered it computes the results and stores them in the database and displays them.
If an old URL is entered then it fetches the results from the database and displays them.
